        <h3>Uncle Vanya: Act IV by Anton Chekov</h3>
            <h5 class="VOITSKI">VOITSKI.</h5> 
            <p.direction>[Kissing HELENA'S hand fervently]</p>
            <p.speech>Good-bye--forgive me. I shall never see you again!</p>

            <h5 class="HELENA">HELENA.</h5> 
            <p.direction>[Touched]</p>
            <p.speech>Good-bye, dear boy.</p>

            <p.direction>[She lightly kisses his head as he bends over her hand, and goes out.]</p>

            <h5 class="ASTROFF">ASTROFF.</h5> 
            <p.speech>Tell them to bring my carriage around too, Waffles.</p>

            <h5 class="TELEGIN">TELEGIN.</h5> 
            <p.speech>All right, old man.</p>

            <p.direction>[ASTROFF and VOITSKI are left behind alone. ASTROFF collects his paints and drawing materials on the table and packs them away in a box.]</p>

            <h5 class="ASTROFF">ASTROFF.</h5> 
            <p.speech>Why don't you go to see them off?</p>

            <h5 class="VOITSKI">VOITSKI.</h5> 
            <p.speech>Let them go! I--I can't go out there. I feel too sad. I must go to work on something at once. To work! To work!</p>

            <p.direction>[He rummages through his papers on the table. A pause. The tinkling of bells is heard as the horses trot away.]</p>

            <h5 class="VOITSKI">ASTROFF.</h5> 
            <p.speech>They have gone! The professor, I suppose, is glad to go. He couldn't be tempted back now by a fortune.</p>

            <p.direction>[MARINA comes in.]</p>

            <h5 class="MARINA">MARINA.</h5> 
            <p.speech>They have gone.</p>
            <p.direction>[She sits down in an arm-chair and knits her stocking.]</p>

            <p.direction>[SONIA comes in wiping her eyes.]</p>

            <h5 class="SONIA">SONIA.</h5> They have gone. God be with them.</p>
            <p.direction>[To her uncle]</p>
            <p.speech>And now, Uncle Vanya, let us do something!</p>

            <h5 class="VOITSKI">VOITSKI.</h5> 
            <p.speech>To work! To work!</p>

            <h5 class="SONIA">SONIA.</h5> 
            <p.speech>It is long, long, since you and I have sat together at this table.</p>
            <p.direction>[She lights a lamp on the table]</p>
            <p.speech>No ink!</p>
            <p.direction>[She takes the inkstand to the cupboard and fills it from an ink-bottle]</p>
            <p.speech>How sad it is to see them go!</p>

            <p.direction>[MME. VOITSKAYA comes slowly in.]</p>

            <h5 class="MME">MME. VOITSKAYA.</h5> 
            <p.speech>They have gone.</p>
