        <h1>Kylie Bales does Chekov Tonight</h1>
        <h3>Uncle Vanya: Act IV by Anton Chekov</h3>
        <p>
            <h6>VOITSKI</h6> [Kissing HELENA'S hand fervently] Good-bye--forgive me. I shall never see you again!

            <h6>HELENA.</h6> [Touched] Good-bye, dear boy.

            [She lightly kisses his head as he bends over her hand, and goes out.]

            <h6>ASTROFF.</h6> Tell them to bring my carriage around too, Waffles.

            <h6>TELEGIN.</h6> All right, old man.

            [ASTROFF and VOITSKI are left behind alone. ASTROFF collects his paints and drawing materials on the table and packs them away in a box.]

            <h6>ASTROFF.</h6> Why don't you go to see them off?

            <h6>VOITSKI.</h6> Let them go! I--I can't go out there. I feel too sad. I must go to work on something at once. To work! To work!

            [He rummages through his papers on the table. A pause. The tinkling of bells is heard as the horses trot away.]

            <h6>ASTROFF.</h6> They have gone! The professor, I suppose, is glad to go. He couldn't be tempted back now by a fortune.

            [MARINA comes in.]

            <h6>MARINA.</h6> They have gone. [She sits down in an arm-chair and knits her stocking.]

            [SONIA comes in wiping her eyes.]

            <h6>SONIA.</h6> They have gone. God be with them. [To her uncle] And now, Uncle Vanya, let us do something!

            <h6>VOITSKI.</h6> To work! To work!

            <h6>SONIA.</h6> It is long, long, since you and I have sat together at this table. [She lights a lamp on the table] No ink! [She takes the inkstand to the cupboard and fills it from an ink-bottle] How sad it is to see them go!

            [MME. VOITSKAYA comes slowly in.]

            <h6>MME. VOITSKAYA.</h6> They have gone.
