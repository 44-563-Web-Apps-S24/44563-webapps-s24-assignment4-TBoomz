        <h1>Kylie Bales does Chekov Tonight</h1>
        <h3>Uncle Vanya: Act IV by Anton Chekov</h3>
            <h5>VOITSKI.</h5> 
            <p>[Kissing HELENA'S hand fervently]</p>
            <p>Good-bye--forgive me. I shall never see you again!</p>

            <h4>HELENA.</h4> 
            <p>[Touched]</p>
            <p>Good-bye, dear boy.</p>

            <p>[She lightly kisses his head as he bends over her hand, and goes out.]</p>

            <h4>ASTROFF.</h4> 
            <p>Tell them to bring my carriage around too, Waffles.</p>

            <h4>TELEGIN.</h4> 
            <p>All right, old man.</p>

            <p>[ASTROFF and VOITSKI are left behind alone. ASTROFF collects his paints and drawing materials on the table and packs them away in a box.]</p>

            <h4>ASTROFF.</h4> 
            <p>Why don't you go to see them off?</p>

            <h4>VOITSKI.</h4> 
            <p>Let them go! I--I can't go out there. I feel too sad. I must go to work on something at once. To work! To work!</p>

            <p>[He rummages through his papers on the table. A pause. The tinkling of bells is heard as the horses trot away.]</p>

            <h4>ASTROFF.</h4> 
            <p>They have gone! The professor, I suppose, is glad to go. He couldn't be tempted back now by a fortune.</p>

            <p>[MARINA comes in.]</p>

            <h4>MARINA.</h4> 
            <p>They have gone.</p>
            <p>[She sits down in an arm-chair and knits her stocking.]</p>

            <p>[SONIA comes in wiping her eyes.]</p>

            <h4>SONIA.</h4> They have gone. God be with them.</p>
            <p>[To her uncle]</p>
            <p>And now, Uncle Vanya, let us do something!</p>

            <h4>VOITSKI.</h4> 
            <p>To work! To work!</p>

            <h4>SONIA.</h4> 
            <p>It is long, long, since you and I have sat together at this table.</p>
            <p>[She lights a lamp on the table]</p>
            <p>No ink!</p>
            <p>[She takes the inkstand to the cupboard and fills it from an ink-bottle]</p>
            <p>How sad it is to see them go!</p>

            <p>[MME. VOITSKAYA comes slowly in.]</p>

            <h4>MME. VOITSKAYA.</h4> 
            <p>They have gone.</p>
