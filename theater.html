        <h1>Kylie Bales does Chekov Tonight</h1>
        <h3>Uncle Vanya: Act IV by Anton Chekov</h3>
        <pre>
            VOITSKI [Kissing HELENA'S hand fervently] Good-bye--forgive me. I shall never see you again!

            HELENA. [Touched] Good-bye, dear boy.

            She lightly kisses his head as he bends over her hand, and goes out.

            ASTROFF. Tell them to bring my carriage around too, Waffles.

            TELEGIN. All right, old man.

            ASTROFF and VOITSKI are left behind alone. ASTROFF collects his paints and drawing materials on the table and packs them away in a box.

            ASTROFF. Why don't you go to see them off?

            VOITSKI. Let them go! I--I can't go out there. I feel too sad. I must go to work on something at once. To work! To work!

            He rummages through his papers on the table. A pause. The tinkling of bells is heard as the horses trot away.

            ASTROFF. They have gone! The professor, I suppose, is glad to go. He couldn't be tempted back now by a fortune.

            MARINA comes in.

            MARINA. They have gone. [She sits down in an arm-chair and knits her stocking.]

            SONIA comes in wiping her eyes.

            SONIA. They have gone. God be with them. [To her uncle] And now, Uncle Vanya, let us do something!

            VOITSKI. To work! To work!

            SONIA. It is long, long, since you and I have sat together at this table. [She lights a lamp on the table] No ink! [She takes the inkstand to the cupboard and fills it from an ink-bottle] How sad it is to see them go!

            MME. VOITSKAYA comes slowly in.

            MME. VOITSKAYA. They have gone.
